One of the great aspects of Python is the large code base already available by other developers. For more specific software taylored to scientific disciplines, we can use some third party libraries available from PyPi or conda-forge. These are libraries built and maintained with open-source practices and available for use through the same installation process as the regular scientific libraries.

For example [Atmospheric data Community Toolkit (ACT)](https://github.com/ARM-DOE/ACT) is a library designed to make reading, quality control, and plotting much simpler with atmospheric science data. Radar data analysis and plotting is made simpler with the [PyART](https://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/) library.
