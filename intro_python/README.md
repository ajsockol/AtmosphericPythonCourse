# Intro Python Module

A good online free tutorial is available at [Datacamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science). This is a 4 hour course that should give you the basics of Python programming. It would also be good to review the PDF in this folder for some other detials the course may not teach.
