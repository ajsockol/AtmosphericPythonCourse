# AtmosphericPythonCourse

This is a Git repo of some example python3 files. It is designed to work by calling the
python script from the command line. Each example file has blocks of code to process
controld by an if statement. Just change "False" to "True" to execute those bits of code.
It is suggested to also change the previous "True" to "False" to limit the amount of
information printed to the screen.

There is also a test_requirements.py script that will ensure all the libraries listed
in requirements.txt are installed. Run that script to check for missing libraries.
If a missing library is detected insall using pip.

> pip install <missing library name>

Enjoy and happy coding.
