# This is a comment in a YAML file. YAML stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language"
# or "Yet Another Markup Language". It is designed to be very human readable as compared
# to XML or JSON but still ASCII type text. Since we will read this into python as a
# dictionary, the same rules apply to the names you can give to the keys.

# A basic "key-value" pair
a_variable_name: "A value to list with the variable"
b_variable_name: A value to list with the variable but no quotes. Some assumptions are made.
c_variable_name: 1  # this is interpreted as an int
d_variable_name: 11.  # this is interpreted as a float

# We can also have a list of values, not just one value. A list is defined
# by starting the row with "- " characters. A list element can contain any
# python interpretable object, string, int, float, dictionary, list.
d_list_name:
    - 1  # this is an int
    - 2.  # this is a float
    - 3.00 # this is a float
    - one  # this is a string
    - two and a half  # this is a string
    - 'three or four'  # this is a string
    - "this is a string
       with a return in the YAML file
       but not once it is read in." # using ' or " will work the same

        This is a different
        way to have multiline text
        in the YAML file. It will be stored as a single string in Python.
        Notice how the end has a newline added at end of string.

        This will be a string
        that preserves the new line
        in the read in string.
    - ['or', 'a', 'list', 'of', 'something']
    - True  # Note how this is not being stored as a string. It's being stored as boolean
    - 'False'  # but this is stored as a string
    - use: True  # this is a way to set configuration to do something or not. It's a dictionary.

# When you have metadata that needs to be stored, YAML is a great
# format. Here is an example you may use. Notice how the different
# levels are defined by spaces, just like python loops. This is read
# in as a dictionary of dictionaries.
